## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop an image file or click to browse
2. **Configure Settings**: 
   - Set desired width and height (leave empty for auto)

   - Toggle aspect ratio preservation
3. **Process**: Click "Resize Image" to process
4. **Download**: Click "Download" to save the resized image

### Settings Explained

- **Width/Height**: Set specific dimensions in pixels. Leave empty to maintain original size or auto-calculate based on aspect ratio.
- **Quality**: Controls compression level. Higher values = better quality but larger file size.
- **Format**: 
  - **JPEG**: Best for photographs, smaller file sizes
  - **PNG**: Best for graphics with transparency
  - **WebP**: Modern format with excellent compression
  - **GIF**: For animated images

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Only image files are allowed"**
   - Ensure you're uploading a valid image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

2. **"File size must be less than 10MB"**
   - Compress your image before uploading or use a smaller image

3. **Server won't start**
   - Check if port 3000 is already in use
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

4. **Images not processing**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure the server is running
   - Verify network connectivity

### Performance Tips

- For large images, consider resizing to reasonable dimensions first
- Use WebP format for best compression/quality ratio
- Lower quality settings (60-80%) often provide good results with smaller files

### Transparency Tips

- **Best Results**: Works best with images that have white or light backgrounds
- **Format Requirements**: Transparency is only available for PNG and WebP formats
- **Quality**: Higher quality settings preserve more detail in transparent areas
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for logos, icons, and graphics that need transparent backgrounds
